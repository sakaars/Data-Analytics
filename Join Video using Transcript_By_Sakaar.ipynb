It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

Look at how beautiful this is. And there's a Lamborghini Veneno. Yeah, someone's out there calling their... ...if your kuntages... My goodness, this is just a toy store here. Special thanks to Lamborghini Montreal. Good invite to check out the place being in Canada for the first time. Oh my goodness. That is crazy beautiful. Look at that. I think this is the Ascenza. Yeah, I think this is the Ascenza. So rare. But not as rare as this. De Veneno. Here we have here the Lamborghini Veneno. This is just crazy. One of three and I'm seeing one in person for the first time. Oh god, it's so gorgeous. I can't believe it. One of three and it's right here in front of me. It's just an honor seeing this in person. God. Beautiful design. Timeless. Timeless, timeless, timeless. This is a special collection for a special owner in the future. I think it's... I know it's 13 million Canadian dollars or it's like what? 11 million in US dollars? Woo! Man, it's just an honor seeing this in person. Beautiful, beautiful. So I know this thing has a 6.5 liter V12. It said it's supposed to be like what? 220-221 miles per hour. In any case, it's just fantastic pushing it 740 horsepower of it and just a design that is just one of a kind. God damn. Right next to a sensor right here too. Jesus Christ. Just beautiful. Oh my god. I'm just in Lamborghini heaven right now. I think 40 were available I believe? Not too sure. I got a fact check that but still a very limited production. Corgis, gorgeous. I just can't... Man, I can't believe I'm seeing this in person as well. 5.0 liter. Not 5. What the hell? 6.5 liter V12. I think pushing a 12. I think this one is more powerful than the Veneno without a doubt. Beautiful. Look at its wing. Look how sleek and aerodynamic it is. Another gorgeous model. The Parallel and Brimble carbon ceramic brakes. Huge. But I like the Veneno's tires better. Like the Veneno's tires better look at. I really like the spokes around it. But in any case having these two back to back. Just exhilarating. Woo. God damn. It's very funny that only 112 of these were made of the Lamborghini Cuntash. And I'm talking about the recent models. I think it's the L-P804, if I may suspect. We hold on one sec. Yup. L-P800. So they're both beautiful hybrid cars. Yup, they are indeed hybrid. 112 are made. These beautiful ones are here in the showcase. Lovely, lovely. We got the Performance right here too. Ours, Performance. Another unique and private. Gorgeous, gorgeous. I really like this color. I love the around-shell colors of Lamborghini's. Well, there are 12 as well. It's just in all and an honor and a privilege being in this showcase in this dealership of Lamborghini Montreal. They have fantastic Lamborghini's. Definitely check them out. They got the Revolto's. By the corner you see the Revolto's. Got an SV Avenador. Huracans. Beautiful Huracans to go in the back. You have your technical right here. Again, beautiful models. Definitely check out this fantastic place at Lamborghini Montreal. Great service, great energy. This is Lamborghini for me. Mr. B, take care y'all.\n",
