# Automated YouTube Video Segment Extractor and Merger Using Transcripts
This Python project simplifies the process of creating a single video from selected portions of multiple YouTube videos. Designed with accuracy and user convenience in mind, the script automates video downloading, transcript generation, and precise segment extraction based on user-defined text inputs. By leveraging advanced libraries such as yt-dlp for video downloads, whisper for speech-to-text transcription, and moviepy for video editing, the project offers a seamless and efficient workflow.


# Key Features
User-Friendly Input: The script guides users through the process, asking for the number of videos and their respective YouTube URLs. Users can then specify text to identify the portions of each video's transcript they wish to extract.

1) Enhanced Transcript Matching: To ensure precision, the project employs fuzzy string matching using the fuzzywuzzy library. This feature allows for flexible text matching, accommodating variations in phrasing or minor errors in user input.

2) Interactive Workflow: Once a matching transcript segment is found, the user is presented with the start and end timestamps, along with the corresponding text. This interactive process allows users to confirm and extract the relevant video segment.

3) Seamless Video Processing: Extracted video segments are saved and concatenated into a single high-quality video using moviepy. The process supports customizable transitions and ensures efficient video merging.

4) Error Handling and Validation: Robust error-handling mechanisms notify users of issues like video download failures, unmatched text in the transcript, or segment processing errors. Users can choose to retry or skip problem areas, ensuring uninterrupted workflow.


# Use Cases
This tool is perfect for creating highlight reels, assembling educational materials, or merging specific scenes from multiple videos without the need for manual editing. Itâ€™s particularly useful for:

1) Content Creators: To compile relevant clips for social media or presentations.
2) Educators: To curate learning materials from various video resources.
3) Researchers: To gather and process video data efficiently.


# Requirements
Libraries:
yt-dlp (for video downloads)
whisper (for transcript generation)
moviepy (for video editing)
fuzzywuzzy (for improved transcript matching)
System Requirements: FFmpeg must be installed for video processing.


# How It Works
1)Video Download: Users provide YouTube URLs, and the script downloads the videos using yt-dlp.  
2)Transcript Generation: The whisper library generates a detailed transcript of the audio from each video.   
3)Segment Extraction: Users input desired text phrases, and the script identifies the closest matching segments using fuzzy matching. Start and end timestamps are displayed for confirmation.             
4)Video Concatenation: Extracted video segments are merged into a single output file (final_video.mp4) using moviepy.


Conclusion
This project integrates cutting-edge AI models with intuitive user interaction to revolutionize video processing. It eliminates the tedious steps of manual editing, making video creation faster, more accurate, and accessible to a wide audience. Whether you're a content creator, educator, or researcher, this tool is designed to meet your video editing needs effortlessly.
